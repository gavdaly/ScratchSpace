Determins if a phone number is a `landline` or a `cell` in Canada ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦.
It does this by doing a reverse phone lookup and sees if the number is a cell or landline.

This project was done years ago. I recently just updated the dependencies.

## ToDo

- [ ] Add mocking to the tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add sqlite database to cache the results
